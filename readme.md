# megademo

A pastime project for recreating some of the  demo effects from my childhood that I enjoyed tinkering with. This time instead of going full berzerk on CPU cycle tight optimisation in 6510/6502 and x86 assembly I went for [pyxel](https://github.com/kitao/pyxel) (a super nice and easy to approach retro game engine for Python) because I got lazy :) and it just allows me to quickly capture a bit of nostalgy in betweem times.

The term megademo was used to refer to longer then usual demoscene product, that would include an extensive range of effects, so called demo parts. Later demos evolved into a more fluid, story telling like visual experience with a more unified look and stronger visual integrity. Early megademos on the other hand were more like just a series of independent parts, sections, a showcase of graphics routines.
